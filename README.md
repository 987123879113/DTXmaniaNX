## What is DTXMania?
DTXMania is a program that replicates gameplay from Konami's music video game, Gitadora - Drummania/GuitarFreaks. This project was forked from the DTXManiaXG verK SVN repository. It processes DTX files (including older formats such as BMS/BME or GDA/G2D) and allows playing of custom created charts with a use of a game, keyboard or MIDI controller.

For more information regarding creation of DTX files and its data formats, do visit the original [DTXMania Wiki](https://osdn.net/projects/dtxmania/wiki/DTX%20data%20format). Various video tutorials are available from [APPROVED DTX Gaming's YouTube page](https://youtu.be/9GlSk62pgGw).
